This starts each morning at 6am with other crazies like myself who think suffering through a HIIT session at the local gym, and sweating like a moron will make me look 21 again (kind of not working!), through to breakfast around the table with my family talking Rugby, Minions and Smurfs, this includes the cat (who by the way thinks he’s human and has selective hearing, never comes when you call him but can suddenly hear his food being served up from outside!) through to the wonderful people that I work alongside at Spark who can make me cringe, blush, giggle and snort with laughter all at the same time!  My Why is something that I then ask myself each night before I go to bed – and that is “Who Did I Help Today?”.  Doesn’t matter how significant or pintsized that interaction may have been, but my hopes are that I somehow, in some way made a positive difference in someone’s life.",
        "Int": "It’s fair to say I’m a sporting kind of gal, I love most sports and can quite happily watch most sports, although if you make me watch wrestling and darts, you’re probably going to the bottom of my Christmas Card list!  Netball specifically is my passion, both playing in my younger days (not so long ago, just saying!) and coaching, I’ve coached from Elite level to grassroots and everything in between.  I’m also a self-confessed gym-bunny, not the fluffy leg-warmers, pink head-band bunny, Im more the \"dying while trying to breath, working out in a top thats inside out (cos I got dressed in the dark!) looking not so flash\" kind of bunny!  This is what gets me going each morning - some people need a coffee to wake up, I need the gym!  I also love spending time with my family who keep life highly entertaining and ridiculously funny, their interests are my interests!   \n \nIn my career, my area of interest isn’t technical (although if you count the TV remote, consider yourself lucky!) but “People” is my thing.  I enjoy finding out about what makes people tick, what excites them each day, their aspirations in life and what they’re truly passionate about.  Achieving a healthy work-balance is core to who I am and what I believe brings out the best in people, but achieving that can often be difficult.  My passion is guiding and coaching others to achieve this work-life balance also, while supporting them in their journey and making sure they take the time to stop and smell the flowers (and pluck out those crappy weeds!) along the way.  I wish I could tell you my area of interest was growing coconut trees in the backyard, teaching dogs how to surf or knitting earmuffs in 50 different colours ... but really, how boring would that be!

        "MemorableExp": "The birth of my beautiful little boy in 2010.  Life for me changed when he rocked into my world and brought all the sparkles, rainbows and glitter with him!  He was born 3 weeks early as he was obviously getting bored hibernating for nearly 9 months and thought it was about time his mummy and daddy started learning how to become super cool parents.  Although the birth itself was memorable in a kind of “holy %#@*$%, give me pain relief” way, the outcome at the end when my little precious pork-chop was born made it all worth it.  And yes, the sparkles, rainbows and glitter continue to still rock my world every single day as I continue learning from this little boy how to be the best mummy I can be, and how I apparently need to take cooking lessons!",
        "Inspiration": "Mother Teresa – she lived her Why on every level, every single day, every hour, every minute.  Her unconditional love for children, the poor and the downtrodden and the legacy she has left speaks for itself.  She lived a simple and humble life serving others and giving all of herself, and never wanting anything in return except for love and kindness to be the one universal language of the world. \n\nMy family – they keep my size 11 feet firmly grounded, they put up with my abysmal cooking, they laugh at my ridiculous jokes, they allow me to cry when I watch animal movies, they don’t mind that I hang with like-minded crazies at the gym at 6am and they accept all my little quirks like drowning steak in tomato sauce and drinking milk straight out of the carton!  But most of all, they inspire me because they make me laugh every single day and ensure I remember how blessed I am to have the life I have with them in it! ",
